Gameplan in the works

Our Goal:
Create a 2d multiplayer scrolling game with a destructible, chunk-based environment based around planet masses of various sizes.

New (to us) technologies and problems:
    - Building a game engine
    - Client-server communcation and logic
    - Graphics optimization
    - Threading

Currently we have a working game engine which can receive user input, process that command, and return a movement output to the screen.  This functionality has been put on hold until we are able to communicate via network
